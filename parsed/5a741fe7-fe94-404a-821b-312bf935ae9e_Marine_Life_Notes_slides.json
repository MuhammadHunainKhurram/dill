        "Camouflage (Counter-illumination): Some organisms, like certain squid, produce light on their bellies to match the faint light from above, making them less visible to predators below.",
        "Attraction: Anglerfish have bioluminescent lures to attract prey. Similarly, some jellyfish use light to lure small fish.",
        "Communication: Certain species of marine worms and shrimp use light signals to find mates or coordinate group behaviors.",
        "Defense: Some squids and small crustaceans release bioluminescent fluids to distract predators, allowing escape."

      "bullets": [
        "Bioluminescence is more common in deep-sea environments than shallow waters because sunlight cannot reach the depths.",
        "The color of bioluminescent light is typically blue or green because these wavelengths travel farthest in water.",
        "Some fish can control the intensity and duration of their glow, flashing patterns to signal warnings or confuse predators.",
        "Scientists are studying bioluminescence for applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and bioengineering."
